Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., true/false, 0/1) based on input features. The algorithm estimates coefficients that map input features linearly to the log-odds of the outcome using a logistic (sigmoid) function. During training, it optimizes these coefficients to minimize the logistic loss, typically using gradient descent. In prediction, it computes the probability of the positive class and applies a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to make binary predictions. Logistic regression is efficient, interpretable, and widely used for tasks like spam detection, disease diagnosis, and more, where outcomes are binary.
